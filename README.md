# Concept: Scum here
  My concept consist of a parody of Sim city, combined with elements of DungeonKeeper. Your goal is to build a large city, just like in sim   city. But instead of keeping the people satisfied, you need to maintain an as low as possible satisfaction rate, without killing the  citizens.

# Planning and technical plans

* **week 1 & 2:**
Thinking about concepts.
* **week 3:**
Starting to think about technical obstacles and start with activity diagram.
* **week 4:**
prototyping and working on basic mechanics of the game (menu's, UI etc)
start at making a grid system which will display a button when hovered upon. The function of this button should be different depending on the state of the tile (either built-up or not/ buildable or not)
Identifying the required classes and behaviour

* **week 5:**
 Finish working on basic mechanics of the game.
 Finish grid system
 Start on building selection and city-satisfaction system
 
 * **week 6:** 
 Finish working on building selection and city-satisfaction system
 Improving city-satisfaction AI
 
 * **week 7:**
  if there's time: Playtests
  Bug fixes / improvements
 
# learning goals and targets
By working on this game I hope toto gain or improve the following skills:
* Writing structured and more modular code
* Gain a better understandig of polymorphism
* Using events and delegates to keep code as independent as possible
* Working in a more structured fashion in order to keep my code maintainable
