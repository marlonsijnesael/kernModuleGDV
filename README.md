# Concept: Scum City
  My concept consist of a parody of Sim city, combined with elements of DungeonKeeper. Your goal is to build a large city, just like in sim   city. But instead of keeping the people satisfied, you need to maintain an as low as possible satisfaction rate, without killing the  citizens.

# Planning and technical plans

Thinking about concepts.
* week 3:
Starting to think about technical obstacles and start with activity diagram.
* week 4:
prototyping and working on basic mechanics of the game (menu's, UI etc)
